      <h1>Reflection About Sportfest</h1>

      <br>
        <p>At the beginning of Sportsfest, it was fun. At first, the opening was beautiful, and the dance competitions were also great. It's fun watching some sports, especially basketball and volleyball, because they were two of the most competitive sports at the time, but after that, most of us are tired because of the heat and humidity surrounding us, and sometimes I feel like I don't want to attend but I have to because of the attendance and, of course, my allowance, but overall it was great because I get to watch many interesting sports.</p>
